            "I'm new to energy supplements and didn't know what to expect. I was worried I'd be too wired and was skeptical about long-term benefits. Big Richard Energy's, The Y-PLEX, completely changed the way I view supplements. I'm energized but not over amped up. I'm able to play extra games of basketball and feel great after. Mental clarity is greatly improved. I'm a believer!"

            "As a man on the back side of my 40's I've noticed a dip in my energy, stamina, focus and sex drive. I tried testosterone replacement and hated the needles and injections. My levels plummeted after ending the protocol, but I did not want to go back to TRT therapy. I've used Big Richard Energy's, The Y-PLEX, for two months and I'm blown away at how it's restored my energy, strength, and endurance. Also, a happy wife makes a happy life. Big Richard Energy is true to its name in the bedroom. It's great to know there's a testosterone boosting product that doesn't require injections or medical intervention."

            "Big Richard Energy's, The Y-PLEX, has given me such a boost of natural daily energy. It's so much easier to stay focused. With work and 3 kids in multiple sports I get overwhelmed trying to remain on top of things. Now I stay present on what I need to do in the moment and what needs to happen next."
